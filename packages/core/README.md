# Vue Promise Dialogs

> A tiny & modern library that allows you to work with dialogs as with asynchronous functions.

## Why?

Because many dialogs work exactly as promises. 
They are opened (called) and then closed with some result (resolved) or canceled (rejected).

## Install

> From version 2.0.0 it works for Vue 2 and Vue 3 within a single package by the power of [vue-demi](https://github.com/vueuse/vue-demi) ðŸ”¥

### Vue 3

```sh
npm install vue-promise-dialogs
```

### Vue 2

```sh
npm install vue-promise-dialogs @vue/composition-api
```

## Usage

Main requirements:

1. You should mount exactly one `PromiseDialogsWrapper` somewhere in your application root.
2. The dialog component should accept `params` props.
3. The dialog component should emit `resolve` or `reject` events when the user makes a decision.

```ts
import { createPromiseDialog } from "vue-promise-dialogs"

interface BooleanDialogParams {
    text: string;
}

const BooleanDialog = defineComponent({
    template: `
      <div class="dialog">
          <p>{{ params.text }}</p>
          <button name="true" @click="$emit('resolve', true)">True</button>
          <button name="false" @click="$emit('resolve', false)">False</button>
          <button name="cancel" @click="$emit('reject', 'cancel')">Cancel</button>
      </div>
    `,
    props: {
        params: {
            type: Object as PropType<BooleanDialogParams>,
            required: true,
        },
    },
});

// First type argument is the type of params prop that will be passed to component
// Second type argument is the type of value with which the promise will be fulfilled
const openDialog = createPromiseDialog<BooleanDialogParams, boolean>(BooleanDialog);

// When you call this function, dialog will be mounted to `PromiseDialogsWrapper`.
// When user press any button and resolve/reject event emitted, promise will be settled and dialog will be destroyed.
const result: boolean = await openDialog({ text: 'Some text' });
```

### Unmount delay

By default, a dialog is unmounted immediately right after resolve/reject, but maybe you want to change this behaviour, for example, to play the close animation. 

You have two options here:

1. Specify the unmount delay (in ms) using `unmountDelay` prop in `PromiseDialogsWrapper`.
2. Specify the unmount delay (in ms) as a second argument when emitting `resolve`/`reject` event. This option will override `unmountDelay` prop if both are provided.

### Close all

In some cases you may want to close all opened dialogs. For example, on route change.

You can use `closeAllDialogs` for this. All you need is to set a reason, which will be used in promises reject.

## TODO
- [ ] Fallback to mount dialogs without PromiseDialogsWrapper
